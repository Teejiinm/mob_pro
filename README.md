# Habit tracker

This habit tracker allows users to track their daily activities or goals, such as “Read” and “Run.” The green highlight and checkmarks visually indicate completed tasks, while unmarked boxes show pending tasks. It’s a simple and clean design to help users maintain their habits and visually track progress over time.
